# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh            # publish the CURRENT package.json version
#   ./scripts/release.sh patch      # bump patch, then publish   (0.2.0 -> 0.2.1)
#   ./scripts/release.sh minor      # bump minor, then publish   (0.2.0 -> 0.3.0)
#   ./scripts/release.sh major      # bump major, then publish   (0.2.0 -> 1.0.0)
#
# Order is deliberate: validate -> bump+tag (local) -> publish -> push.
# If publish is cancelled/fails, nothing is pushed to GitHub; just fix and
# re-run 'npm publish && git push --follow-tags origin main' to finish.
